# Hello, I'm George! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a financial data scientist and machine learning researcher, with a focus on natural language processing and Bayesian modelling. Iâ€™m based in New York and I work for [Point72 Asset Management](https://www.point72.com/).

In my ~copious~ free time, I contribute to and maintain several open-source libraries (particularly the PyMC project). Away from the keyboard, I spend my time drinking coffee, taking photos and obsessing over [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).

Previously, I studied engineering at The Cooper Union with minors in computer science and mathematics, and I interned at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) on their quant research and data science teams.

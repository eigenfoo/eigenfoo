# Hello, I'm George! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data scientist and machine learning researcher based in New York City. I like natural language processing, Bayesian modelling, open source software and coffee. Iâ€™m based in New York and I work for [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/).

In my ~copious~ free time, I contribute to and maintain several open-source libraries (particularly the PyMC project). Away from the keyboard, I spend my time drinking coffee, taking photos and obsessing over [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).

Previously, I worked at [Point72 Asset Management](https://www.point72.com/) and [Quantopian (acquired by Robinhood)](https://robinhood.engineering/our-journey-to-robinhood-99ab41472361), and studied engineering at The Cooper Union with minors in computer science and mathematics.
